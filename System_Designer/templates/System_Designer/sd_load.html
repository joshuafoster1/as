<h1>Welcome to the Load Profile tool!</h1>
<p>This is where you will add, and edit all of the components that will be drawing power in your system. <br>
  <br>Add everything! Phones, computers, lights, microwaves, refridgerators, water pumps and anything else.
  <br>The more accurate the profile you build here is, the better the system will work to your needs.
  <strong>This is the most critical information in determining the components and size of the system you require.</strong>
  If this is not accurate, the system can not be guarinteed.<br><br>
  To start, Simply select a preset item, or make your own.

//it may be a good idea to actually build a separate app for the load profile. Because we're gonna be adding, removing and developing items,
//it may make more sense to just break it out. Use an "admin" like view for editing that information. Offer an easy portal for customers
//to directly edit their "database" of items, but reference our pre-populated one.
