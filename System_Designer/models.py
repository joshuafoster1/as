        #batteryMonitoringSystem -- bool does this have a battery monitor

    #solar_panel -- this is gonna be the selected panel thats producing power
    #solar_panel2 -- incase there are two different sized panels    
    #generator -- this is going to have to be its own product with lots of variables to calculate on, if blank we need to ignore it.
    #solarLocation -- this is going to be a singular variable designed around this map. /static/img/solarProductionMap.jpeg the user will click their "worst case area of travel" which will just spit back a number. (covering hours/day of sunlight, and insulation)

        Take all accesories and calculate the peak load potential for the system.

        BD - this will be used primarily to calculate if the battery bank can handle a full blown draw (dont want to
        exceed a @20hr draw rate) as well as if the inverter is of adequite size. (Inverter is ac only, may need to track those specifics of ac vs dc)

        estimate the likely recharge needs based on latitude, winter camoing potential
        vehicular moves.

        BD -- It may be wise to think about this more as "estimated recharge potential". Capacity will be a static amount based on battery selection.
