      -click map get value
Battery capacity
  - total storage required vs peak discharge rates
      - discharge rates

Module prodution
  - solar insolation factor (power from the sun)
     - panel wattage
     - panel voltage
     - winter camping
  - base items off needs from usage calculations
  
Production needs to keep battery capacity above 50%
  - production vs draw (must keep batteries from ever dropping below 50%, think about night loading)

Product Selection
  - relationship table to see what thresholds mandate which products
  - need to think about anchoring specific items into the build
  - generator
     - check if required based on parameters

  - some things are derived, some will need to be checked for after design is complete,
    some will need to be chosen
